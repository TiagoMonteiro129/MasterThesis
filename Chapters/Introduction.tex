\section{Context and Motivation}
There has been an increase in the number of users with internet access over the past decades, in 2018, more than half of the world's population is already using internet on daily basics, and almost 60 per cent of the world's homes have internet~\cite{2018stat}.

With the unprecedented increase in users, the IT sector is actively more concerned with energy management in hardware and software development, and based on a study carried out, the energy consumed by the ITC sector is approximately 1,500 TWh, corresponding to approximately 10 per cent of the worldwide energy reproduced ~\cite{CCOAL18}.

Currently, with great affluence of gadgets usage (smartphones, smartwatches, smart homes), result in greater volume and users synchronizing data in the Clouds. This user gain has a direct impact on a data centre's workload and energy consumption.

Any reduction in energy consumption, however small, in a data centre has a significant impact on the platforms on the remaining equipment, as this impact affects the machine globally~\cite{portela2016}.

Although there are policies to reduce data centre energy consumption, it expected that energy consumption in the data centre would increase ~\cite{trends}.

\section{Objectives}

As already mentioned, this research aims at understand Which \gls{dbms} software is the greenest in real-life environments, and what is the difference between them in energy consumption? Besides, because \gls{dbms} can take up a lot of disk space, we also want to understand disk energy consumption. Our final aim is to consider the effect various users have on energy consumption.

With all these interrogations, we made this following research questions which we will try to answer:


\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1} :\textit{Which Database Management Systems is the most energy-efficient?}
In this research question, we want to understand which DBMS has less energy spent on overall. We also want to know which DBMS is more efficient at CPU-level and in the Disk level.. 
 \item \textbf{RQ2} :\textit{Which Database Management Systems has the best transitions per energy Spent?}
 With this research question, we desire to understand which DBMS has the transition per energy spent rate.
  \item \textbf{RQ3} :\textit{Which Database Management Systems is the most energy-efficient with a different number of users?}
While some DBMS can be suitable energy-efficient at the CPU level and others on disk storage, we pretend to understand the overall impact that the number of users has on the different DBMS on the overall energy consumption and what DBMS is the most scalable.
\end{itemize}
