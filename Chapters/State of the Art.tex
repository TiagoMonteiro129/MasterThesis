\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{cha:StateofArt}

This chapter presents the literature review and the state of the art of technologies involved in carrying out this project.  First, Section~\ref{sc:DBMS} shows in detail \gls{dbms}: it starts by describing a brief history of \gls{dbms}, the advantages of using them, and the different \gls{dbms} models. Then how to benchmark \gls{dbms} and their benchmark systems. Next, in Section~\ref{sc:greensoftware}, we present green software focusing on the work related to this study. 
Finally, Section~~\ref{sc:energyconsumption} explains the concept of energy, how energy can be measured, which are the most relevant subsystems in energy consumption, and the various solutions for monitoring the energy consumption of a system.
