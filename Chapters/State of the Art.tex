\label{cha:StateofArt}

This Chapter presents the literature review and the state of the art of the technologies involved in carrying out this project.  Section~\ref{sc:DBMS} presents in detail data base management systems: we start by describing a brief history of DBMS, the advantages of using them, and the different DBMS models. We also discuss how to properly benchmark DBMS, and their benchmark systems. Next,  in Section~\ref{sc:greensoftware}, we present green software focusing in the  work related to this study. 
Finally, Section \ref{sc:energyconsumption} explains the concept of energy, how energy can be measured, which are the most important subsystems in energy consumption, and the various solutions for monitoring the energy consumption of a system.
