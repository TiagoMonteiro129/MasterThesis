\chapter{Benchmark Architecture and Design}
\label{cha:middle}

%This chapter presents the fundamental process of development and execution of The Benchmark, from the energy model used to the tests performed. Thus, Section \ref{sc:enerymodel} defines an energy model that we consider essential to achieve a ea model. Then, in Chapter \ref{sc:dbtest} it will be presented the DBMS under test and their reasons to be included in this study.  In Chapter \ref{sc:Design} it is given the tests made and an explanation for their designs. Finally, in Chapter \ref{sc:execution} it is present the execution of this study.


This Chapter presents the necessary steps of our methodology to measure and compare different DBMS. Section \ref{sc:enerymodel} defines the energy model that supports our methods. Afterward, in Section \ref{sc:dbtest}, we present the DBMS we consider in our study.  Then, Section \ref{sc:Design} describes the design of the benchmarks we defined. Finally, in Section \ref{sc:execution}, we show their execution process.
