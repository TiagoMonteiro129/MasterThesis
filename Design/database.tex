After having Relational databases dominated the software industry for a long time, the advantage that they have is of being well structured with strong data store structures, concurrency control and interfaces.

We decide to choose the 3 of the most trendy relational databases that Hammerdb could support and one non-relational database.~\cite{DBR}.
The DBMS chosen where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mysql : explicar e Motivos a frente
  \item Postgres : explicar e Motivos a frente
  \item MariaDB : explicar e Motivos a frente
  \item Redis : explicar e Motivos a frente
\end{itemize}

For consistency reasons, we use the TPC-C model provided by hammerdb and apply to every database. 
%nao tenho acerteza se devo por esta parte

In the TPC-C database model, a wholesale parts supplier operates out of a number of warehouses and their associated sales districts. 
In this model, each warehouse has to supply ten sales districts, and each district serves three thousand customers. An operator in a sales district can choose one of the five operations or transactions provided by the order-entry system of the Business at any time.  The frequency of the individual transactions, like the transactions themselves, is based on practical scenarios.

For simplification reasons we decide to play this configuration to our model:

\input{tables/databaseconfig}

%TPPC WEBSITE REF???

Another cautions we did to have more reliable results was to mount the DBMS on this disk because we don't want the operating system interfering on our measurements.
