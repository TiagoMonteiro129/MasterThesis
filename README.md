# NOVAthesis LaTeX template

--------

*If you are here looking for the (deprecated) Word templates (not maintained anymore), please go to [this other repository](https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis_word).*

--------

The NOVAthesis LaTeX class is a thesis template initially designed for the PhD and MSc thesis at [FCT Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (FCT-NOVA)](http://www.fct.nova.pt), Portugal. The class provides utilities to easily set up the cover page, the front matter pages, the page headers, etc. with respect to the official guidelines of the FCT-NOVA for writing PhD dissertations.

The template is easily customizable, including the support for other institutions as well. Currently the template supports out-of-thebox (at least): 17 Chapter Styles, 7 font sets, 4 schools.  If you customize this template for your institution or add new style files, please [let me knwow](http://docentes.fct.unl.pt/joao-lourenco) about the thorns in the process, so that I can work a bit to smooth them.  Thanks!
